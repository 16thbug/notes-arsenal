C language was developed by **Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories.** In 1989, the C language was standardized, where C language features were defined, also known as the 1989 ANSI standard for C, and that is the reason, you will see C language also called C89, because of the 1989 ANSI standard.

The current latest version of the C language is C99, as some new features were added to the C language in 1999.

1999, was more than 20 years ago, but the C language is still very relevant and widely used although there are many other new languages like C++, Java, Python, C#, etc. in the market.

C Language is a middle-level, structured programming language, that needs a compiler for running the programs written in C language.

### History of C language

C language has evolved from three different structured languages ALGOL, BCPL, and B Language. It uses many concepts from these languages while introducing many new concepts such as datatypes, struct, pointer, etc.

BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, based on which the C language was created by Ken Thompson. And then the C language was the language which the C language was created.

In 1989, the language was formalized by Americal National Standard Institute (ANSI).

In 1990, a version of C language was approved by the Internation Standard Organization (ISO), and that version of C is also referred to as C89.

-   1960 - ALGOL - International Group
-   1967 - BCPL - Martin Richard
-   1970 - B - Ken Thompson
-   1973 - Traditional C - Dennis Ritchie
-   1989 - C or C89 - ANSI Committee
-   1990 - ISO C - ISO Committee

After the C language was accepted worldwide and programmers around the world started using it, soon, to improve C language further, the work on the development of C++ language started.

The idea behind creating C language was to create an easy language that requires a simple compiler ( to translate the code from English to binary ( 0â€™s and 1â€™s that computer understands )) and to enable programmers to write complex programs in a language which is close to English because earlier programmers had to write Machine instruction which was very difficult to remember,

> C language compiler converts the readable C language code into machine instructions.

## Why is the C language so popular?

C language is a very good language to introduce yourself to the programming world, as it is a simple and easy-learn language that is capable of doing wonders.

Programs that are written in C language take very little time to execute and almost execute at the speed of assembly language instructions. (Assembly level instructions are nothing but direct commands to communicate with the computerâ€™s hardware.)

Initially, C language was mainly used for writing system-level programs, like designing Operating Systems, because in the â€™80s ( 1980 - 89 ) the fight to make a stable, worldwide accepted operating system was going on.

But C language was can be used to develop other applications as well, like Text Editors, Compilers, Network Drivers, many traditional PoS ( Point of Sale ) software like Restaurant Billing Systems, etc.

> The most widely used version of the C language is still C89 and C99.\

## Summary:

<aside> ðŸ’¡ **What is the C language?**

</aside>

It is a computer language developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories.

It is a programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system UNIX, but later it was used for developing software programs for daily usage. It is still being used to develop operating systems and for creating system-level programs, by big tech companies ( FAANG companies ).

<aside> ðŸ’¡ **What are the features of the C language?**

</aside>

C is one of the most popular programming languages. It has many features.

-   **Modularity** - It allows the reusability of modules. It has header files which readymade functions that you can use.
-   **Middle-Level language** - It combines both the advantages of low-level and high-level languages. ( C arrays, C Pointers, etc.)
-   **General-purpose programming language** - It can be used to implement any kind of application just like Python.
-   **Portability** - C program can be compiled or executed in any operating system, ( Unix, DOS, Windows ). You can compile the program in Windows and then run it on a Unix machine, it will run without any issue,
-   **Powerful programming language** - It is a very efficient and powerful programming language. It is best used for data structures and designing system software.
-   **C is a case-sensitive language.**

<aside> ðŸ’¡ **What is C language used for?**

</aside>

It is amongst one of the most portable languages and is mainly used for creating system applications that form a major part of Windows, UNIX, and Linux operating systems.

C is a general-purpose programming language. It is used for enterprise applications, games, graphics, applications requiring calculations, or simply software, etc.

<aside> ðŸ’¡ **Where is C used today?**

</aside>

C is used for developing operating systems and Kernel-level programs.

It is used for the production of Compiler. We can develop desktop as well as mobile phone operating systems with the help of C, for example Android.
